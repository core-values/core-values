# Core Values

Over lunch, a small group of like-minded individuals thought

> "Wouldn't it be nice if we could have a shared values statement"

Something that can help define our goals and approach to problem solving
and collaboration. Something that projects can adopt as a signal. Something
to set a base line.

This project will attempt to distill a set of core values that can be shared
across people, projects, and industries. This vision may chnage over time.
